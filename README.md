 # Rubetek
Rubetek is an iOS app that makes it easy for users to control their smart home devices, including cameras, intercoms, and more. I began working on this project as a middle iOS developer, but have since been promoted to team lead. As the team lead, I am responsible for overseeing the global architecture of the app, facilitating communication between different teams, and managing various other aspects of the project. Through my efforts, the app has continued to evolve and improve, offering a seamless and intuitive user experience.

The end result was a well-designed and user-friendly app that has enhanced the experience of visitors to the ski resort.
